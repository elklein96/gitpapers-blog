## Getting Started With Android

Before you build your first Android App, you have to set up a development environment.

Eclipse is an **IDE** (Integrated Developer Evnironment). This means that it will help you out by correcting, organizing and compiling code.


### Downloading Eclipse

======

[Click here to download Eclipse](http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-432/keplersr2)

The latest package of Eclipse (4.3.2) includes tools for Java development, and support for Git, a version control system.

Once you have downloaded the file, run through the installation wizard.

### Configuring Eclipse

======

Once you've opened up Eclipse, push OK when prompted to create a *workspace*. This will be the subdirectory where you store all of your projects on your computer.
