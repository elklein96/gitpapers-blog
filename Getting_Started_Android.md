Before you build your first Android App, you have to set up a development environment.

Eclipse is an **IDE** (Integrated Developer Evnironment). This means that it will help you out by correcting, organizing and compiling code.

## Downloading Eclipse


[Click here to download Eclipse](http://eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-standard-432/keplersr2)

The latest package of Eclipse (4.3.2) includes tools for Java development, and support for Git, a version control system.

When the file finished downloading, run through the installation wizard.

## Configuring Eclipse


Once you've opened up Eclipse, push *OK* when prompted to create a *workspace*. This will be the subdirectory where you store all of the projects on your computer.

Next, you need to install the Android SDK.

## Setting up the Android SDK and ADT Plugin

1. [Click here to download the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).  Unpack it into a directory of your choice.

2. In Eclipse, select **Help -> Install New Software**.

3. Click *Add*.

4. In **Name** enter "ADT Plugin".  In **Location** enter `https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/`. Click *OK*.

5. Select **Developer Tools** (leave NDK alone for now) then click *Next*.

6. Accept all of the agreements then click *Finish*.

7. Restart Eclipse.

8. In the "Welcome to Android Development" window select **Use existing SDKs**. Browse and select the directory where you unpacked the SDK.

9. In Eclipse, select **Window -> Android SDK Manager**.

10. Check **Tools**, **Extras** and all of the Android APIs you want to work with. Click **Install** and accept the license agreements.

Now that you've set up Eclipse it's time to make your first Android App!
