Hello,

This is my first post to GitPapers.  I think this site is the next Facebook.  I wish I could meet Zuckerberg.  Six degrees of seperation, so hey you never know, right?  The number six is cool.  Do things usually come in sixes?  Maybe they come in threes.  I can count to three.  One, two, FIVE!  Wait, who has the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch?
