Wow, that first post was so fun, I think I'll make another one!  CodeDay is really cool.  Especially the one in Philly because I'm here.  I hear that dinner is coming soon.  That's pretty fun.  I like to eat.  Joey Chestnut also likes to eat.  A lot.  I mean that guy has an iron stomach.  That kinda sounds like a super hero name.  The Iron Stomach.  Imagine saying that name in a really deep, dramatic voice.  It's gonna be the next Superman, I can tell.
